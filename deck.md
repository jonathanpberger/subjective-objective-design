# Product Strategy, Tactics, & Tips for keeping it together
Balanced Team Conference, 2013

Jonathan Berger, Pivotal Labs

### Someone asked

> How is product strategy is integrated into lean startup and agile teams? High level strategy and product vision can often be left out of the process when pushing toward an MVP. Perhaps you guys have had some experience with this? Do you have a technique or process that helps with this?

---

### The plan

1. How can product vision be kept in view when pushing toward an MVP?
2. How is product strategy best integrated into lean startup and agile teams?
3. How does this all fit together?

---

## How can product vision be kept in view when pushing toward an MVP?

---

# 1. The Big Design Refactor (+ product)

---

This looks like a story about design

but it's really a story about rhythm

---


## In the beginning...

---

There's a

**product (hypothesis)**

---

There's a

**visual design system**

---

Then

**we start building**

---

Product

**writes (tactical) stories**

---

Development

**I.N.V.E.S.T., small pieces**

---

Design solutions:

**Malleable, never done, holistic**

---

Then,
## product iterates

---


**degrades under the weight of a thousand tiny changes**

---


**designers have to play catch-up in a race they can't win**

---


## What should designers do?

---


## Understand and accept

---


**this design-system degradation is an affordance of differently-sized design and development cycles**

---


**Designers need not work at developers tempo**

---


**stay in-rhythm with development, not on-pace**

---

**Communicate**

---

**keep an eye on the health of the graphic system**

---

**manage your design debt**

---

## How?

- Mention that the system is breaking down
- Keep solving the tactical problems
- keep delivering value

---

**the balance shifts**

---

**raise the alarm**

---

**Design retro**

---

**Do systematic Visual Design**

---

## What DOES THE BIG DESIGN REFACTOR look like?

- is mostly on whiteboards or Adobe Creative Suite
- includes product ~4-7x / week
- pings development ~1-2x / week to consult on technical implications

---

**Near the end of Big design refactor**

- deliver a set of user stories accompanied by mockups
- It’ll often take an IPM or two to get through all of them
- it’s important that they get implemented soon

---

**Costs of delay**

- Nothing feels more like waste than a heavy investment in design
- followed by unacted-upon stories that go stale
- This will kill trust between design product (in both directions)

---

**After the Big Design refactor**

- new design is being built
- designers occasionally hop back into Adobe for assets or newly-discovered UX tweaks
- most design time is spent pairing with developers

---


**until the next refactor**

- designers pair on stories, work on design problems revealed by user testing
- ~66% development and 33% Adobe apps
- The debt clock is starting to tick again, and once the pain is noticeable, start making noises

---


**“we’re ok for right now, but we’ll need a design refactor in the next 3-5 weeks”**

---


**...and the cycle repeats**

---

***work with the Big Design Refactor, not against it.***

---

## Use these rhythms

to balance strategic product vision and tactical pivots

---

---

# 2. How is product strategy integrated into agile teams?

---

> High level strategy and product vision can often be left out of the process when  pushing toward an MVP.

---

*A few techniques:*

- Lean Hypotheses
- Assumptions Label
- Idea board

---

Technique
# 2a: Use Lean Hypotheses to Define an MVP

---

## people fall in love
with the idea of

"Minimum Viable Product"

---

**It’s minimal!**


So there’s less risk.

---

**It’s viable!**


So it’ll prove something!

---

**It's a Product**


That's what we're supposed to build!

---

Unfortunately
## it’s easy for the line of “minimum” or “viable” to slip.

---

## How can a team stay focused?

---

***A Lean Hypothesis can help.***

---

**It's a tool that takes the form of**

---

We believe

*[TYPE OF USER]*


has a problem

*[DOING THING].*


We can help them with

*[OUR SOLUTION].*


We'll know we're right if

*[CHANGE IN METRIC].*

---

e.g.


**Hamazon**



---

![hamazon](http://0c03c44c910a09f376cf-76270917bdab3706370e630fe99f803c.r48.cf1.rackcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/hamazon_logo-107x50.png)'s

PROBLEM:

> Users are clicking around and spending lots of time-on-site, but they’re not putting items in their cart and converting.

---

We believe

*SHOPPERS*


have a problem

*CHOOSING FROM THE MASSIVE SELECTION OF PORK PRODUCTS*


We can help them by


*SHOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OTHER SHOPPERS*


We'll know we're right if


*SHOPPERS ADD ITEMS TO CART MORE QUICKLY*

---

an MVP can be defined as
## the least amount of work we can do to in/validate the hypothesis.

---


**recommendation engine**


(expensive!)

---

a more specific problem:


**shoppers need guidance**

---

MVP: test this hypothesis


**curate a featured selection products**

---

**cheaper**


than building a recommendation engine

---

if it fails,
## iterate

---

if it succeeds,


**iterate**

---

It’s possible our segmented curation would get so specific that we’d end up building a recommendation engine, but we’d only do so if the business needs, rather than our intuition, led us there.

---

In that way, we iterate towards


**a truly minimal, truly viable product.**

---

## The hypothesis ties our tactical actions back to our strategic vision.

Technique
# 2b: The <s>Bullpucky</s> Assumptions Label

---

Agile leverages
**low cost of change**

---

to power
**short feedback loops**

---

to help
**build the right thing**

---

this means
**near-term plans are very clear**

---

but
**long-term plans are hazy**

---

Sometimes,
**long-term planning is necessary**

---

*what to do?*

---

option 1:
## Build a long-term backlog

- project teams fight this for weeks
- Client gets irate and frustrated
- we finally lose
- schedule a (miserable) half- or one- or two-day mini-inception

---

## What happens during the mini-inception?

---

*estimate every story*

*in painstaking detail*

*for the next few quarters*

---

## What happens after the mini-inception?

---

*re-estimate half those stories in angry IPMs*

---

*the estimates are wrong*

---

*grumbling “we told you these estimates were <s>bullpuckey</s>”*

---

---
## the Assumptions Label technique:

---
## Hold a 2-3hr Meeting
- with the PM and 1 or 2 devs
- Estimate epics at a multiples-of-8-point level of granularity
- rough out your feature tracks

---

## Put it in Tracker
- Write titles in all caps
- Don’t bother writing a description for the story.
- It’s ok to use multiple 8-pointers to get to the number you need.

---

## Throw an “assumptions” label on all these stories
- they’re easier to wrangle
- (and it never hurts to drive the point home).

---

[![The Assumptions Label technique in action.](http://pivotallabs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/assumptions-label-short1.gif)](http://pivotallabs.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/assumptions-label-short1.gif)

---

## This helps the Client / PM
- re-prioritize coarse-grained blocks of epic
- estimated completion dates will adjust
- create rough estimates
- cut scope or add pairs.

---

## This helps the devs
- these won't be mistaken for actual, deliverable stories.
- In fact, these “assumption” stories become a decent way to see what’s next when story-writing.
- IPM or pre-IPM often becomes an exercise in picking the top assumption off the top of the file and fleshing it out into real stories.

---

## everyone gets better visibility into the project.
- dev and designe can set better expectations for their PMs,
- PMs can set proper expectations for their boss
- trust is preserved on the team.

Technique
# 2c: The Idea Board

---

## Inception ends
- with a fully fleshed out backlog for the next few iterations,
- some farther-off, coarse-grained, Epic-level ideas written on index cards.

---

## What to do with epic-level cards?

---

***externalize them***

---

## Making the Idea Board

---

- an Epic-level reverse-Kanban board
- work in concert with Pivotal Tracker.

---

## Create a few columns:
- Now
- Next
- Later

---

Generally you'll have

- 2-3 cards in the Now column,
- another 2-3 in the Next Column,
- and the rest (~20-40) in the Later column.

---

## Why it's useful

---

## it externalizes future epics

1. so everyone is reminded they exist, and
2. can see their relative priority

---

it gives Stakeholders a place to

## park long-term ideas

---

and to

## feel that their contributions are included

---

## it gives a big-picture view

that tactical what-are-we-working-on-this-week systems have trouble displaying succinctly.

---

**(This is great for strategic-level Release Planning meetings that I like to try to have every 3 or 4 weeks.)**

---

On a recent project, we had a bit of

## Priority Whiplash

---

**\< storytime \>**

---

## Analog vs digital

---

Some say a big drawback to a strategic paper-based system like the Idea Board is that over time, it falls out of sync with a tactical digital system like Pivotal Tracker.

---

I think this is more a feature than a bug: when the Idea Board has one or two epics that are out of sync with reality it's no big deal.

---

When the whole board is a big lie, that's a signal to the whole team that it's time for everyone to re-asses the the alignment between tactical steps and strategic goals: it's time for a Release Planning meeting.

Technique
# 2d: Back to basics

the standard agile toolkit

---

agile has done this well for years using tools like

- YAGNI
- Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
- 5 Why's
- INVEST stories
- user testing
- short (weekly?) iterations
- IPMs
- release planning

---

# 3. How does this all fit together?

---

## 5 Big Problems
- When is design "done"?
- How much design should a project start with?
- Why is Agile so tough for designers?
- How can designers achieve sustainable pace?
- How do we slice objective design off from subjective design?

---

## Possible Solution techniques

---

## testing:
- help us slice objective from subjective
- helps us know when we're done

---

## make it right, make it work, make it fast
- work at the right level of resolution

---

## pairing:
- knowledge transfer,
- un-silo'ing pain across team
- SEE QUANDORA
